Contributions are welcome!

## Rules
- Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on *GitHub* or *GitLab*.
- The pull request must contain commits *you made yourself*.
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your Hacktoberfest participation.
- If a maintainer reports behavior that‚Äôs not in line with the project‚Äôs code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
- To get a shirt, you must make *four approved pull requests (PRs)* on opted-in projects between *October 1-31* in any time zone.
- This year, the first *55,000 participants* can earn a T-shirt.

A repository/project is considered to be participating in Hacktoberfest if the *'hacktoberfest'* topic is present and is accepting public contributions via pull requests. An individual pull request can also be opted-in directly by adding the *'hacktoberfest-accepted'* label.

A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall *approving review* from maintainers, has been *merged* by maintainers, or has been given the *'hacktoberfest-accepted'* label. A pull request with any label containing the word *'spam'* or *'invalid'* will be considered ineligible for Hacktoberfest.
